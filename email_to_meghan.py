Hi Meghan,

I wanted to give you a quick update on what your husband has been building (with a lot of time, energy, and brainpower), and explain in plain English whatâ€™s going on with this new trading system weâ€™ve launched.

ðŸ§  What We Built  
Together, Derek and I have created a fully automated trading system. That means it watches the market, picks trades, places buy and sell orders, tracks results, and even sends a daily performance email â€” all with zero manual input during the day.  
(Though to be fair, Derek has done **a ton** of work upfront â€” think of it as building a financial robot that works while he sleeps.)

ðŸ’¼ What It Does  
Every weekday, the system:  
- Scans what members of Congress and company insiders are buying  
- Monitors internet trends (like whatâ€™s hot on Reddit or Twitter)  
- Picks stocks or options it believes will grow  
- Automatically buys and sells based on smart rules  
- Sends Derek a full report at the end of each day

We're aiming for around **1% account growth per day** â€” a high but realistic goal for this type of strategy.

ðŸ§  A Few Quick Terms:
- **Stocks** = Pieces of a company (like buying Apple)  
- **Options** = A cheaper way to bet on a stock going up (**calls**) or down (**puts**)  
- **Shorts** = A way to profit if a stock goes down  
- **Bid/Ask** = The price negotiation between buyers and sellers â€” our system simulates this too

Derekâ€™s ultimate goal? To grow your family's wealth in the background â€” using AI, data, and automation. Heâ€™s putting in the hard work now so you both can enjoy more freedom later.
